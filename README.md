# maxjongg

This is an implementation of the famous Majong game (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong).

## Motivation

I have the ongoing inclination to (re-)implement games that I used to play back in the days - or up until this day. Because with every such implementation, I figure out some mechanics - be it of the game itself or of ways to put logic and ideas into code.

And while we're at it, there's always the chance to learn about new browser features and web stuff in general.

## Technologies used

The app is implemented using React and TypeScript and was scaffolded via `create-react-app`.
For hosting I chose vercel as I do for most of my side projects.

## Visual decisions

I wanted to have a sort of trashy 80s style to the game and combine it with the 3D requirements. The main inspiration for the colors and the glowing effects was the VS Code theme [Synthwave '84](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode).
